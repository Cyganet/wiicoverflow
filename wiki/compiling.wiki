=Compiling CoverFloader=

Since r1064 the project has been updated to make use of portlibs. In order to compile you will need to have DevkitPPCr21 or higher and the relevant portlibs included in your DevkitPro environment. These should be downloaded from [http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/files/portlibs/ the portlibs download page].

See [http://devkitpro.org/wiki/portlibs the portlibs wiki] for details of how to set this up.

The required portlibs are:
  * zlib
  * freetype
  * mxml
  * libpng
  * sndlib
